          It constitutes understanding threshold of emotional arousal, managing the immediate
          environment, maintaining rapport, harmony, and comfort with others, letting others feel
          comfortable in your company. It also involves being honest in interpersonal dealings,
          interpreting emotional cues truthfully, realizing communicability of emotions, moods and
          feelings, and having an insight into how others evaluate and relate to you.
