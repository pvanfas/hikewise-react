          Abstract reasoning refers to the ability to reason beyond the obvious. It is concerned
          with being able to understand complex concepts and assimilate new information beyond
          previous experience. It includes the ability to detect and analyse patterns and
          relationships among discrete pieces of information and solve problems on a complex,
          intangible level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abstract Reasoning is necessary for success in positions that require effective problem
          solving and decision-making, especially when nonverbal forms of information are involved.
