          Mechanical Reasoning is the ability to understand basic mechanical principles of
          machinery, tools, and motion. The focus is on simple principles that involve reasoning as
          opposed to specific knowledge.

          Mechanical Reasoning is important for any sort of work involving the application of
          principles of commonly encountered physical forces, and design, operation or repair of
          equipment.
